If you think one of my projects is interesting or you find my notes useful, please let me know :]

My Notes
===============
I decided to write notes in order to deepen my understanding, and to provide a reference to my future self who is prone to forgetting things.
I decided to share them because I hoped that someone else might find them useful.
Their primary objective is to be clear, concise and thorough references for someone who is familiar with the topic.
Their secondary objective is to be a dense guide through topics, that have just enough demonstration that someone could learn the topics based off of them.
